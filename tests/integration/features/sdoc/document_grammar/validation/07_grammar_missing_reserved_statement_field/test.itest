CHECK: error: could not parse file: {{.*}}input.sdoc.
CHECK: Semantic error: Grammar element 'REQUIREMENT' is missing a reserved content field declaration, one of {STATEMENT, DESCRIPTION, CONTENT}.
CHECK: Location: {{.*}}input.sdoc:6:1
CHECK: Hint: A content field plays a key role in StrictDoc's HTML user interface as well as in the other export formats. It is a reserved field that any grammar element must have.
